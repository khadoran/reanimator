Reanimator is an editor for the _single player_ distribution of Hellgate London developed by Flagship Studios.

**Reanimator** features include:
  * Read, create and modify core game libraries.
  * Platform for distributing modifications.
  * View and edit your saved characters.
  * _Trade items_ between characters.

Using Reanimator, we have created a **modification** that:
  * Unlocks subscriber only content.
  * Increases inventory and storage space.
  * Imports content from MP expansions (Stonehenge and Abyss).
  * Tweaks game balance from player stats to spawn counts.


To get started with Reanimator, you need a working copy of Hellgate London (the single player version). If you havn't already patched to version 1.2, [download the patch here](http://www.hellgateaus.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=80).

Extract Reanimator to any directory. When you run for the first time, you may be prompted to locate your installation directory. Once located, you are now ready to being modding! Please see wiki for more specific detail on Reanimator features.
